	work in win10 with 'Microsoft Print To Pdf' virtual printer
		but much better because can be used in batch mode, without prompt for target file name 
	
	but can also work stand-alone for differents file types
		raw text  as    	"txt", "log", "lst", "bas", "bi", "inc", "me", 
							"c", "cpp", "h", "hpp", "cxx", "hxx", "inf",
							"bat" , "cmd" and even  ""   (ex for makefile)
		
		pictures  as		"bmp", "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "tiff", "gif"
				it will try to reproduce the 'real size' checking dimensions and dpi resolution
				and try also to best fit , so rotate 270Â° when needed.
